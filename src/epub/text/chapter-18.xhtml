				<p epub:type="title">Surrender of Geronimo</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>On February 11, 1887, the Senate passed the following resolution:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“<b>Resolved</b>, That the Secretary of War be directed to communicate to the Senate all dispatches of General Miles referring to the surrender of Geronimo, and all instructions given to and correspondence with General Miles in reference to the same.” These papers are published in the Senate Executive Documents, Second Session, 49th Congress, 1886⁠–⁠7, Volume <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, Nos. 111 to 125. For an exhaustive account of the conditions of Geronimo’s surrender the reader is referred to that document, but this chapter is given to show briefly the terms of surrender, and corroborate, at least in part, the statements made by Geronimo.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Upon assuming command of the Department of Arizona, General Nelson <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Miles was directed by the War Department to use most vigorous operations for the destruction or capture of the hostile Apaches.</p>
			<p>The following extracts are from instructions issued April 20th, 1886, for the information and guidance of troops serving in the southern portion of Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“The chief object of the troops will be to capture or destroy any band of hostile Apache Indians found in this section of country, and to this end the most vigorous and persistent efforts will be required of all officers and soldiers until the object is accomplished.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“A sufficient number of reliable Indians will be used as auxiliaries to discover any signs of hostile Indians, and as trailers.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“To avoid any advantage the Indians may have by a relay of horses, where a troop or squadron commander is near the hostile Indians he will be justified in dismounting one-half of his command and selecting the lightest and best riders to make pursuit by the most vigorous forced marches until the strength of all the animals of his command shall have been exhausted.”</p>

			<p>The following telegrams show the efforts of the United States troops and the coöperation of Mexican troops under Governor Torres:</p>

This is the fifth time within three months in which the Indians have been surprised by the troops. While the results have not been decisive, yet it has given encouragement to the troops, and has reduced the numbers and strength of the Indians, and given them a feeling of insecurity even in the remote and almost inaccessible mountains of Old Mexico.’</p>

One of our scouts, in returning to Fort Huachuca from Lawton’s command, met him, Naiche, and thirteen other Indians on their way to Fronteraz; had a long conversation with them; they said they wanted to make peace, and looked worn and hungry. Geronimo carried his right arm in a sling, bandaged. The splendid work of the troops is evidently having good effect. Should hostiles not surrender to the Mexican authorities, Lawton’s command is south of them, and Wilder, with G and M troops, Fourth Cavalry, moved south to Fronteraz, and will be there by 20th. Lieutenant Lockett, with an effective command, will be in good position to-morrow, near Guadalupe Cañon, in Cajon Bonito Mountains. On the 11th I had a very satisfactory interview with Governor Torres. The Mexican officials are acting in concert with ours.’</p>

			<p>General <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">O. O.</abbr> Howard telegraphed from Presidio, San Francisco, California, September 24, 1886, as follows:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>”⁠ ⁠… The 6th of September General Miles reports the hostile Apaches made overtures of surrender, through Lieutenant Gatewood, to Captain Lawton. They desired certain terms and sent two messengers to me (Miles). They were informed that they must surrender as prisoners of war to troops in the field. They promised to surrender to me in person, and for eleven days Captain Lawton’s command moved north, Geronimo and Naiche moving parallel and frequently camping near it.⁠ ⁠… At Skeleton Cañon they halted, saying that they desired to see me (Miles) before surrendering.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>After Miles’s arrival he reports as follows:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>“Geronimo came from his mountain camp amid the rocks and said he was willing to surrender. He was told that they could surrender as prisoners of war; that it was not the way of officers of the Army to kill their enemies who laid down their arms.”</p>
				<p>”⁠ ⁠… Naiche was wild and suspicious and evidently feared treachery. He knew that the once noted leader, Mangus-Colorado, had, years ago, been foully murdered after he had surrendered, and the last hereditary chief of the hostile Apaches hesitated to place himself in the hands of the palefaces.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Continuing his report, General Howard says:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>”⁠ ⁠… I believed at first from official reports that the surrender was unconditional, except that the troops themselves would not kill the hostiles. Now, from General Miles’s dispatches and from his annual report, forwarded on the 21st instant by mail, the conditions are plain: First, that the lives of all the Indians should be spared. Second, that they should be sent to Fort Marion, Florida, where their tribe, including their families, had already been ordered.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D. S.</abbr> Stanley, Brigadier General, telegraphs from San Antonio, Texas, October 22, 1886, as follows:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p>”⁠ ⁠… Geronimo and Naiche requested an interview with me when they first ascertained that they were to leave here, and in talking to them, I told them the exact disposition that was to be made of them. They regarded the separation of themselves from their families as a violation of the terms of their treaty of surrender, by which they had been guaranteed, in the most positive manner conceivable to their minds, that they should be united with their families at Fort Marion.</p>
				<p>“There were present at the talk they had with me Major <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. P.</abbr> Wright, surgeon, United States Army; Captain <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. G.</abbr> Ballance, acting Judge-advocate, United States Army; George Wratton,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> the interpreter; Naiche, and Geronimo.</p>
				<p>“The Indians were separated from their families at this place; the women, children, and the two scouts were placed in a separate car before they left.</p>
				<p>“In an interview with me they stated the following incident, which they regard as an essential part of their treaty of surrender, and which took place at Skeleton Cañon before they had, as a band, made up their minds to surrender, and before any of them, except perhaps Geronimo, had given up their arms, and when they were still fully able to escape and defend themselves.</p>
				<p>“General Miles said to them: ‘You go with me to Fort Bowie and at a certain time you will go to see your relatives in Florida.’ After they went to Fort Bowie he reassured them that they would see their relatives in Florida in four and a half or five days.</p>
				<p>“While at Skeleton Cañon General Miles said to them: ‘I have come to have a talk with you.’ The conversation was interpreted from English into Spanish and from Spanish into Apache and vice versa. The interpreting from English into Spanish was done by a man by the name of Nelson. The interpreting from Spanish into Apache was done by José Maria Yaskes. José Maria Montoya was also present, but he did not do any of the interpreting.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Wood, United States Army, and Lieutenant Clay, Tenth Infantry, were present.</p>
				<p>“General Miles drew a line on the ground and said, ‘This represents the ocean,’ and, putting a small rock beside the line, he said, ‘This represents the place where Chihuahua is with his band.’ He then picked up another stone and placed it a short distance from the first, and said, ‘This represents you, Geronimo.’ He then picked up a third stone and placed it a little distance from the others, and said, ‘This represents the Indians at Camp Apache. The President wants to take you and put you with Chihuahua.’ He then picked up the stone which represented Geronimo and his band and put it beside the one which represented Chihuahua at Fort Marion. After doing this he picked up the stone which represented the Indians at Camp Apache and placed it beside the other two stones which represented Geronimo and Chihuahua at Fort Marion, and said, ‘That is what the President wants to do, get all of you together.’</p>
				<p>“After their arrival at Fort Bowie General Miles said to them, ‘From now on we want to begin a new life,’ and holding up one of his hands with the palm open and horizontal he marked lines across it with the finger of the other hand and said, pointing to his open palm, ‘This represents the past; it is all covered with hollows and ridges,’ then, rubbing his other palm over it, he said, ‘That represents the wiping out of the past, which will be considered smooth and forgotten.’</p>
				<p>“The interpreter, Wratton, says that he was present and heard this conversation. The Indians say that Captain Thompson, Fourth Cavalry, was also present.</p>
				<p>“Naiche said that Captain Thompson, who was the acting assistant adjutant general, Department of Arizona, told him at his house in Fort Bowie, ‘Don’t be afraid; no harm shall come to you. You will go to your friends all right.’ He also told them ‘that Fort Marion is not a very large place, and is not probably large enough for all, and that probably in six months or so you will be put in a larger place, where you can do better.’ He told them the same thing when they took their departure in the cars from Fort Bowie.</p>
				<p>“The idea that they had of the treaty of surrender given in this letter is forwarded at their desire, and, while not desiring to comment on the matter, I feel compelled to say that my knowledge of the Indian character, and the experience I have had with Indians of all kinds, and the corroborating circumstances and facts that have been brought to my notice in this particular case, convince me that the foregoing statement of Naiche and Geronimo is substantially correct.”</p>

				</header>
				<p>“<b>General</b>: I have the honor to submit the following report upon military operations and the condition of the Division of the Pacific for the information of the Lieutenant General, and to make some suggestions for his consideration:</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“On the 17th of May, 1885, a party of about fifty of the Chiricahua prisoners, headed by Geronimo, Naiche, and other chiefs, escaped from the White Mountain Reserve, in Arizona, and entered upon a career of murder and robbery unparalleled in the history of Indian raids.</p>
				<p>“Since then, and up to the time of my assuming command of this division, they had been pursued by troops with varying success.</p>
				<p>“After the assassination of Captain Crawford, on January 11, by the Mexicans, the hostiles asked for a ‘talk,’ and finally had a conference on March 25, 26, and 27, with General Crook, in the Cañon of Los Embudos, 25 miles south of San Bernardino, Mexico, on which latter date it was arranged that they should be conducted by Lieutenant Manus, with his battalion of scouts, to Fort Bowie, Ariz.</p>
				<p>“The march commenced on the morning of March 28 and proceeded until the night of the 29th, when, becoming excited with fears of possible punishment, Geronimo and Naiche, with twenty men, fourteen women, and two boys, stampeded to the hills. Lieutenant Manus immediately pursued, but without success.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“Simultaneously with my taking command of the division Brigadier General Crook was relieved by Brigadier General Miles, who at once set out to complete the task commenced by his predecessor.</p>
				<p>“Geronimo and his band were committing depredations, now in the United States and now in Mexico, and, being separated into small parties, easily eluded the troops, and carried on their work of murder and outrage.</p>
				<p>“Early in May General Miles organized the hostile field of operations into districts, each with its command of troops, with specific instructions to guard the water holes, to cover the entire ground by scouting parties, and give the hostiles no rest.</p>
				<p>“An effective command, under Captain Lawton, Fourth Cavalry, was organized for a long pursuit.</p>
				<p>“On May 3 Captain Lebo, Tenth Cavalry, had a fight with Geronimo’s band 12 miles southwest of Santa Cruz, in Mexico, with a loss of one soldier killed and one wounded. After this fight the Indians retreated southward followed by three troops of cavalry.</p>
				<p>“On May 12 a serious fight of Mexican troops with the hostiles near Planchos, Mexico, resulted in a partial defeat of the Mexicans.</p>
				<p>“On May 15 Captain Hatfield’s command engaged Geronimo’s band in the Corrona Mountains, suffering a loss of two killed and three wounded, and the loss of several horses and mules, the Indians losing several killed.</p>
				<p>“On May 16 Lieutenant Brown, Fourth Cavalry, struck the hostiles near Buena Vista, Mexico, capturing several horses, rifles, and a quantity of ammunition.</p>
				<p>“The usual series of outrages, with fatiguing chase by troops, continued until June 21, when the Mexicans engaged the hostiles about 40 miles southeast of Magdalena, Mexico, and after a stubborn fight repulsed them.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“About the middle of August Geronimo and his band were so reduced and harassed by the tireless pursuit of the soldiers that they made offer of surrender to the Mexicans, but without coming to terms.</p>
				<p>“Their locality thus being definitely known, disposition of the troops was rapidly made to act in conjunction with the Mexicans to intercept Geronimo and force his surrender.</p>
				<p>“On August 25 Geronimo, when near Fronteraz, Mexico, recognizing that he was pretty well surrounded, and being out of ammunition and food, made overtures of capitulation, through Lieutenant Gatewood, Sixth Cavalry, to Captain Lawton. He desired certain terms, but was informed that a surrender as prisoner of war was all that would be accepted.</p>
				<p>“The Indians then proceeded to the vicinity of Captain Lawton’s command, near Skeleton Cañon, and sent word that they wished to see General Miles.</p>
				<p>“On September 3 General Miles arrived at Lawton’s camp, and on September 4 Naiche, the son of Cochise, and the hereditary chief of the Apaches, with Geronimo surrendered all the hostiles, with the understanding, it seems, that they should be sent out of Arizona.</p>
				<p>“I am not informed of the exact nature of this surrender, at first deemed unconditional.⁠ ⁠…</p>

					<p>Statement of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. T.</abbr> Melton, Anadarko, Oklahoma.</p>
				</header>
				<p>From 1882 to 1887 I lived in southern Arizona, and was employed by the Sansimone Cattle Company.</p>
				<p>In 1886 I was stationed in Skeleton Cañon, about 10 miles north of the boundary line between Arizona and Old Mexico, with <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. D.</abbr> Prewitt. It was our duty to ride the lines south of our range and keep the cattle of the Company from straying into Old Mexico.</p>
				<p>One afternoon, when returning from our ride, we discovered an Indian trail leading toward our camp. We rode hurriedly out of the hills into a broad valley so that we could better discover any attacking parties of Apaches and if assailed have at least a fighting chance for our lives. We knew the Apaches under Geronimo were on the warpath, but they were far down in Old Mexico. However, our knowledge of the Indians led us to expect anything at any time⁠—to always be ready for the worst.</p>
				<p>When we reached the valley we struck a cavalry trail also headed for our camp. This was perplexing, for neither the Indians nor the soldiers seemed to have been riding fast, and both trails led toward our camp in Skeleton Cañon. This cañon was a natural route from Old Mexico to Arizona, and almost all bands of Indians, as well as detachments of United States troops, passed and repassed through this valley when going to Old Mexico or returning therefrom, but never before had two hostile bands passed through here at the same time and traveling in the same direction, except when one fled and the other pursued. What this could mean was a mystery to us. Could it be that the troops had not seen the Indians? Were the redskins trying to head the troops off and attack them in their camp? Were the troops hunting for those Indians? Could this be Lawton’s command? Could that be Geronimo’s band? No, it was impossible. Then who were these troops and what Indians were those?</p>
				<p>Cautiously we rode to our camp, and nailed on the door of our cabin was this notice:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“Be careful, Geronimo is near by and has not yet surrendered.</p>
					<footer>
						<p epub:type="z3998:signature">“<abbr>Capt.</abbr> Lawton.”</p>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Then we understood.</p>
				<p>A short distance above our cabin we found the camp of the troops and we had just finished talking with Captain Lawton, who advised us to remain in his camp rather than risk staying alone in our cabin, when up rode the chief, Geronimo. He was mounted on a blaze-faced, white-stockinged dun horse.</p>
				<p>He came directly to Captain Lawton and through an interpreter asked who we were and what we wanted.</p>
				<p>As soon as the explanation was given he nodded his approval and rode away.</p>
				<p>Prewitt and I rode away with him. We were well armed and well mounted and Geronimo was well mounted, but so far as we could see unarmed. I tried to talk with the chief (in English), but could not make him understand. Prewitt wanted to shoot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> him and said he could easily kill him the first shot, but I objected and succeeded in restraining him. While we were arguing the chief rode silently between us, evidently feeling perfectly secure. All this time we had been riding in the direction of our horses that were grazing in the valley about a mile distant from our corral. When we came to a place about a half mile from Lawton’s camp, where a spur of the mountain ran far out into the valley, Geronimo turned aside, saluted, said in fairly good Spanish, “<i xml:lang="es">Adios, Señors</i>,” and began to ascend a mountain path. Later we learned that he was going directly toward his camp far up among the rocks. We rode on, drove our horses back to the corral and remained in our cabin all night, but were not molested by the Indians.</p>
				<p>The next day we killed three beeves for the Indians, and they were paid for by Captain Lawton. On the second day two mounted Mexican scouts came to Lawton’s camp. As soon as these Mexicans came in sight the Indians seized their arms and vanished, as it were, among the rocks.</p>
				<p>Captain Lawton wrote an account of conditions and delivered it to the Mexicans, who withdrew. After they had gone and their mission had been explained to Geronimo the Indians again returned to their camp and laid down their arms.</p>
				<p>On the next day word reached camp that General Miles was approaching and the Indians again armed and disappeared among the rocks. (Many of the Apache squaws had field glasses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a> and were stationed every day on prominent mountain peaks to keep a lookout. No one could approach their camp or Lawton’s camp without being discovered by these spies.)</p>
				<p>Soon after General Miles joined Lawton’s command Geronimo rode into camp unarmed, and dismounting approached General Miles, shook hands with him, and then stood proudly before the officers waiting for General Miles to begin conversation with him.</p>
				<p>The interpreter said to Geronimo, “General Miles is your friend.” Geronimo said, “I never saw him, but I have been in need of friends. Why has he not been with me?” When this answer was interpreted everybody laughed. After this there was no more formality and without delay the discussion of the treaty was begun. All I remember distinctly of the treaty is that Geronimo and his band were not to be killed, but they were to be taken to their families.</p>
				<figure class="full-page" id="illustration-22">

					<figcaption><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. F.</abbr> Melton, at whose camp in Skeleton Cañon Geronimo surrendered.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>I remember this more distinctly, because the Indians were so much pleased with this particular one of the terms of the treaty.</p>
				<p>Geronimo, Naiche, and a few others went on ahead with General Miles, but the main band of Indians left under the escort of Lawton’s troops.</p>
				<p>The night before they left, a young squaw, daughter-in-law of Geronimo, gave birth to a child. The next morning the husband, Geronimo’s son, carried the child, but the mother mounted her pony unaided and rode away unassisted⁠—a prisoner of war under military escort.</p>
				<p>On the afternoon of the day of the treaty Captain Lawton built a monument (about ten feet across and six feet high) of rough stones at the spot where the treaty was made. The next year some cowboys on a round-up camped at the place, and tore down the monument to see what was in it. All they found was a bottle containing a piece of paper upon which was written the names of the officers who were with Lawton.</p>
				<p>After the Indians left we found one hundred and fifty dollars and twenty-five cents ($150.25) in Mexican money hidden in a rat’s nest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a> near where the Indians had camped.</p>
				<p>About ten o’clock on the morning after the Apaches and soldiers had gone away twenty Pimos Indians, accompanied by one white man, surrounded our camp and demanded to know of Geronimo’s whereabouts. We told them of the treaty and they followed the trail on toward Fort Bowie.</p>
				<p>That afternoon, thinking all danger from Apaches past, my partner, Prewitt, went to ride the lines and I was left in camp alone. I was pumping water (by horse-power) at the well, when I saw three Indians rounding up our horses about half a mile away. They saw me but did not disturb me, nor did I interfere with them, but as soon as they had driven that bunch of horses northward over the hill out of sight I rode quickly off in another direction and drove another bunch of horses into the corral. The rest of the afternoon I stayed in camp, but saw no more Indians.</p>
				<p>The next day we rode over the hill in the direction these Indians had gone and found that they had camped not three miles away. There were evidently several in the party and they had kept scouts concealed near the top of the hill to watch me, and to shoot me from ambush had I followed them. This we knew because we saw behind some rocks at the crest of the hill in the loose soil the imprints left by the bodies of three warriors where they had been lying down in concealment.</p>
				<p>At their camp we found the head and hoofs of my favorite horse, “Digger,” a fine little sorrel pony, and knew that he had served them for dinner. We followed their trail far into Old Mexico, but did not overtake them. We had been accustomed to say “it was Geronimo’s band,” whenever any depredation was committed, but this time we were not so positive.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>We do not wish to express our own opinion, but to ask the reader whether, after having had the testimony of Apaches, soldiers, and civilians, who knew the conditions of surrender, and, after having examined carefully the testimony offered, it would be possible to conclude that Geronimo made an unconditional surrender?</p>
			<p>Before passing from this subject it would be well also to consider whether our Government has treated these prisoners in strict accordance with the terms of the treaty made in Skeleton Cañon.</p>
